# loqui
*latin: to say, speak, tell, talk*

A framework for creating text-based adventure games!

## Goals
- **data-driven**: adding content should be easy and fast
- **beginner-friendly**: content is declared in [toml](https://toml.io/en/), making it easy for beginners to get started
- **versatile**: more complex logic can be written in [lua 5.4](https://www.lua.org/manual/5.4/)
