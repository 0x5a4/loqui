# loqui
*latin: to say, speak, tell, talk*

A framework for creating text-based adventure games, using [toml](https://toml.io/en/) config files 
and lua scripting(TODO).

## Documentation
*(Documentation is very much incomplete)*

- [Rooms](doc/Rooms.md)
- [Interactables](doc/Interactables.md)
- [Commands](doc/Commands.md)
- [Predicates](doc/Predicates.md)
- [Actions](doc/Actions.md)

## Goals
- **data-driven**: adding content should be easy and fast
- **beginner-friendly**: content is declared in [toml](https://toml.io/en/), making it easy for beginners to get started
- **versatile**: more complex logic can be written in [lua 5.4](https://www.lua.org/manual/5.4/)
