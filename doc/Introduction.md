## Quickstart
1. Create a file called `game.toml`
2. Open it, and specify a starting room like this: `starting-room = "myroom"`
3. Create a directory called `content`
4. Any file in that directory ending with `.toml` will be picked up and loaded
5. Now [create some rooms](Rooms.md)

(`starting-room` in `game.toml` needs to have the value of an actual room id)
